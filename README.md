Hello everyone

It's 2024!
**DyexaHub** on ✨ beginning ✨ repository because its `README.md` appears.

Linux and basic programming was caught my eyes
I would love to learn more about basic programming [ HTML, CSS, JS ] and intermediate Linux.
I’m currently learning Linux Debian at Voc High School
Also interest on networking.
I’m looking to collaborate on anything :)

I'd love to receive any help, advice, and suggestions cause I'm still learning with GitHub.

_Thank you ☆_

<!-- UPDATE README SOON -->
